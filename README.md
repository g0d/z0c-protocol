# z0c-protocol
This is the Z0C protocol open interface for programmers to build IoT applications that function under conditions with zero connectivity or under conditions with limited resources. The protocol allows any Windows-based device to become a beacon or a relay and transmit data via the WiFi circuit (without having any connection or access to a loal network or the Internet). In other words Z0C works like a digital CB radio. THe things you can do with Z0C are infinite. Sky is the limit!
